Throughout the development of my project I have followed the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for ensuring clean, consistent and maintainable code.

This project utilises ESLint, a powerful linter for JavaScript, which has been configured to comply with the Airbnb style guide, which has helped me detect warnings and errors, that have been rectified.
